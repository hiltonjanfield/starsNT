This repository is a placeholder. Although the project is in active development, there are no plans to upload it until a stable, usable point has been reached, OR there is significant interest from other developers in contributing. This decision has been made because of the numerous Stars! clone projects that have failed, stalled, or been abandoned over the last 20 years.

## About StarsNT

StarsNT is a re-imagining or reboot of the classic 4X strategy game [Stars! 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars!) (also referred to as "Classic Stars"). The goal is not to clone the game - instead, the goal is to build a game engine that is capable of reproducing the original game as well as being extended and providing game play for games with all sorts of different rules, extended graphics, and more, to cater to all the ideas what major Stars! players have had over the years.

The StarsNT "engine" is based on rulesets. Rulesets define everything in the game - it will theoretically be possible to customize the tiniest element, right up to total conversions.

StarsNT is written using PHP 5.5 and Yii 2.0, and makes extensive use of the technologies behind HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.
